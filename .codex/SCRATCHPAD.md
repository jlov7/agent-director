## Current Task

Execute a world-class documentation pass: perfect README + role-based docs map + technical/non-technical explainers + user-journey visuals.

## Status

Completed

## Plan

1. [x] Audit current docs inventory and identify structure/content gaps.
2. [x] Rewrite `README.md` with role-based navigation, diagrams, visuals, and onboarding-to-adoption narrative.
3. [x] Add audience explainers: technical + non-technical.
4. [x] Add user journey map doc with visual flow diagrams.
5. [x] Upgrade `docs/index.md` to world-class hub with role and lifecycle navigation.
6. [x] Run verification and update trackers.
7. [x] Commit and push changes.

## Decisions Made

- Keep README as the canonical first-entry surface, with docs pages organized by role and depth.
- Preserve the existing ASCII brand block and R&D disclaimer explicitly.
- Prioritize comprehension and onboarding clarity over adding new decorative content.

## Open Questions

- None.

## Verification Gates

- Full validation after docs edits: `make verify`, `make doctor`, `make scorecard`.
