# UX Model

## Modes
- **Cinema** — playback timeline with overlap lanes and inspector.
- **Flow** — semantic graph with edge layers and windowed rendering.
- **Compare** — side-by-side timelines with aligned diff summary.

## Interaction loop
1. Load trace → watch playback.
2. Select a step → inspect details (redacted by default).
3. Switch to Flow → read structure and I/O binding.
4. Replay a step → compare vs base → export diff.

## Story mode + command palette
- **Story mode** auto-runs a guided walkthrough for demos and onboarding.
- **Command palette** (Cmd/Ctrl + K) exposes every action, mode, and safety toggle.
- **Quick actions dock** keeps critical controls within reach during live demos (and can collapse to a single button).
- **Explain mode** adds contextual callouts on hover for every major control.

## Onboarding stack
1. **Intro overlay** sets the three-act mental model (Observe → Inspect → Direct) and offers Tour or Story mode.
2. **Director briefing** surfaces Tour, Story, and Explain in one place.
3. **Guided tour** highlights the main controls in order.
4. **Explain mode** offers just-in-time help on any element.
5. **Story mode** runs the full demo hands-free.

## Keyboard shortcuts
- `Space` — Play / pause
- `← / →` — Step boundary back / forward
- `Shift + ← / →` — Jump to start / end
- `F` — Toggle Flow mode
- `I` — Toggle Inspector
- `S` — Story mode
- `E` — Explain mode
- `T` — Start tour
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` — Command palette
- `?` — Show shortcuts
- `Esc` — Close modal / inspector

## Progressive disclosure
- Step details load only on selection.
- Sensitive payloads are redacted by default.
- Safe export disables raw mode and reveal paths.

## Empty states
- No steps: show onboarding tips and quick actions.
- Large traces: windowed mode defaults on.

## Motion principles
- Morph between Cinema ↔ Flow using FLIP.
- Emphasize status changes via subtle color + glow.
- Reduce motion automatically when user requests.

## Responsive review (automated)
Playwright captures tablet and mobile snapshots to keep layout quality consistent. Generated by `ui/tests/e2e/ux-review.spec.ts`.

### Tablet (900×1100)

## Deep review workflow
Use the UX checklist walkthrough with traces + video for a human-in-the-loop pass:

```bash
make verify-ux
```

The walkthrough is defined in `ui/tests/e2e/ux-checklist.spec.ts`.

Artifacts:
- `ui/playwright-report/` — interactive report with step annotations
- `ui/test-results/` — per-test traces, screenshots, and videos
- `ui/.lighthouseci/` — Lighthouse budgets + metrics
