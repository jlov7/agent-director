# UX Audit Report (2026-02-14)

## Scope
- Deep persona-based UX audit across onboarding, navigation, help, keyboard, mobile, accessibility, and quality perception.
- Evidence gathered from source inspection, Playwright interaction probes, and Lighthouse CI.

## Personas Simulated
- Non-technical first-time user.
- Keyboard-only user.
- Screen-reader/a11y reviewer.
- Mobile demo viewer.
- Technical power user.
- Release reviewer assessing quality signals.

## Pre-fix Findings (resolved)
1. Guided tour allowed focus escape and did not close on `Escape`.
2. Quick-actions toggle was off-screen on mobile viewport entry.
3. Accessible-name mismatch on timeline step cards and quick-actions toggle.
4. Intro auto-dismiss forced first-run progression too quickly.
5. Mini timeline density interaction lacked keyboard operation.
6. Shortcut mismatch: `C` advertised in command palette but not supported globally.
7. Lighthouse console errors from API fallback and missing favicon reduced trust in quality audits.

## Fixes Applied
- Tour keyboard containment + `Escape` close:
  - `ui/src/components/common/GuidedTour.tsx`
  - `ui/src/App.tsx`
- Mobile quick-action discoverability:
  - `ui/src/styles/main.css`
- Accessible naming alignment:
  - `ui/src/components/CinemaMode/StepCard.tsx`
  - `ui/src/components/common/QuickActions.tsx`
- Onboarding pacing (explicit user action required):
  - `ui/src/components/common/IntroOverlay.tsx`
  - `ui/src/App.tsx`
- Mini timeline keyboard support:
  - `ui/src/components/CinemaMode/MiniTimeline.tsx`
- Global `C` shortcut consistency:
  - `ui/src/App.tsx`
- Lighthouse quality-signal cleanup:
  - `ui/lighthouserc.json` (demo-mode build for stable local API-free audits)
  - `ui/index.html` (inline favicon to avoid 404 noise)
  - `ui/src/styles/main.css` (font swap policy tuned to reduce CLS)

## Regression Coverage Added
- New E2E audit regression suite:
  - `ui/tests/e2e/ux-audit-deep.spec.ts`
- Coverage includes:
  - Intro no-auto-dismiss behavior
  - Tour focus trap and `Escape` close
  - Mobile quick-action visibility
  - Intro + tour axe scans
  - Global `C` shortcut behavior
  - Mini timeline keyboard operability

## Verification Evidence
- `pnpm -C ui test -- src/components/__tests__/GuidedTour.test.tsx` passed.
- `pnpm -C ui exec playwright test tests/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts tests/e2e/keyboard.spec.ts` passed.
- `pnpm -C ui exec playwright test tests/e2e/ux-audit-deep.spec.ts` passed.
- `pnpm -C ui lhci` passed after fixes.
- Latest Lighthouse representative summary:
  - performance: `>= 0.85` (passing assertions)
  - accessibility: `1.0`
  - best-practices: `1.0`
  - console errors audit: no findings
