Agent Director is a cinematic, chat‑native debugger for AI agents.

Optional: I can start the guided tour or hit Story mode to auto‑run the walkthrough, then pause and take over.

Here’s a live run. I’ll hit play—notice the playback is driven by real timestamps,
so overlaps are honest and timing is trustworthy.

The Insight Strip surfaces the story instantly.
I’ll jump to the bottleneck and open the inspector.
Sensitive payloads are redacted by default.
With Safe Export enabled, raw mode is disabled entirely.

Now let’s morph to Flow. Same run, new lens.
Structure edges show hierarchy, Sequence edges show order,
and I/O edges show tool bindings.

Let’s do a Director’s Cut.
I’ll replay from this tool step using the Hybrid default.
Now we’re in Compare: aligned timelines with ghost overlays.
The diff summary tells us what changed—steps, cost, wall time.

Finally, we can export the diff for audit or team review.

That’s Agent Director: watch your agent think, then direct it.
